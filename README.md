## Random Maze Generator

# Project Description

The application allows the user to generate a random maze, using parameters for the height and width of the maze. The dashboard shows different widgets:

SidebarPanel : A panel to input the parameters
MainViewPanel: View on which the maze is generated

In order to to get this dashboard we used Shiny package for convenient purposes.

# Limitations:

- A next step would be to create an algorithm that is able to solve the randomly generated maze

# How to Use the Project
First step is to run the app, which will open a new window. Within this window you can specify the parameters for the height and the width of the maze. Once you click on generate, it will create a random maze with the specified values for the parameters.

# If the user want to start over and generate new recipes, he/she has to click on the button 'Reset'. (lets put this in aswell)
